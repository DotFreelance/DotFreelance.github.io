![Jekyll Logo]({{ site.url }}{{ page.main-image }}){:width="350px"}

This technology is new to me. In the course of an evening I managed to build and deploy this small website using a lightweight little framework. This simple stack seems perfect for it.

Let me explain how.

First and foremost, this page is built using the [Jekyll Framework](https://jekyllrb.com) built on top of [Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0). Some of the tools that are used and that I'm familiar with are:
- Sass for CSS
- Liquid Templates
- Markdown

The whole project is deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). This was built as a pre-cursor to the application to **Floatplane**.

Hope you like it!

![Spider Eyes Game]({{ site.url }}{{ page.main-image }}){:width="450px"}

By the end of the shortened term in our Graphics 2 class, the looming requirement to finish a group project reached its peak. Having no other choice, we four got together to come up with an idea and implement it in a sort of game-jam/code-jam approach. We had 5 days.

At first we wanted to implement a 3rd person vision system, using the vision occlusion of 1st person sight to occlude objects for the 3rd person camera. In practice, this appeared to be too complex for our time limit.

Jokingly, I suggested we instead ramp up the number of cameras and become a spider.

**So we did just that.**

In the remaining 3 days, we managed to come together, learn Unity and build a game where you play as a spider, hunted by the deadly iguana who just wants to eat your eyes. The goal of the game -- the game system isn't entirely completed -- is to avoid the iguana who will blot out an eye if he gets too close. If you do lose an eye, you must seek out the power-up eyeball on the play area.

If you lose all eyes, you lose.

Right now, this game is being hosted at [http://jeffreythiessen.com/spider](http://jeffreythiessen.com/spider) (Jeff was one of the members of our team.)

Eventually we would have polished the game, added audio, and made the game challenge more complex, including perhaps a timer to compete on the amount of time you could stay alive.

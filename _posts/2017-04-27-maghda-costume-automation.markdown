Building elaborate costumes for major events like San-Diego Comic Con or Blizzcon means attention to detail.

When putting together this Maghda costume, my friend and his wife **[pictured above]** needed someone to program the Arduino to make those wings flap on an interval. We also needed to setup a system that allowed her to use a button, wired into her glove, that would let her temporarily interrupt the scheduled flapping for a manual flapping, then return to the schedule.

Not complicated in theory,

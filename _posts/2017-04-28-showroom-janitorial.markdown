[![Showroom Janitorial Site]({{ site.url }}{{ page.main-image }}){:width="450px"}](http://showroomjanitorial.com)

A personal contract, this website was a rebuild from an aging design. The web company that had taken on the project originally had been sold,
and it was time to move the whole project on and into the modern web.

While I have experiencing building websites from the ground up, full stack, and in a few different stacks -- LAMP, MEAN --
I knew this rather simple project would be better served by a less complicated approach.

Using a tool called Squarespace, I was able to create a modern design quickly and cheaply, which worked well for the small Manitoba based
business, [Showroom Janitorial, Inc.](http://showroomjanitorial.com)

_Note: this website was built with Laravel by [Tipping Canoe](http://www.tippingcanoe.com), where I worked. I contributed to the project._

[Wareable.com](https://www.wareable.com) is a U.K. based tech blog about Wareable technology.

The stack used here was based on Laravel, a PHP framework with an SQL persistence layer and a heavily modified Bootstrap front end served by Laravel. Images were served by a separate web service for speed, and cached using Cloudflare. The project used continuous integration through Jenkins.

My contributions included:  
- Rebuilding the navigation bar to be more mobile friendly and fluid
- Homepage brick-like layout
- Administration/editor pages for content
- Rebuild and simplification of the project structure using conventions found in a much newer version of Laravel, on top of the new PHP 7
- Various other feature improvements and bug fixes

I learned a lot about project management with this team. I was one of two people on the team, and most of the features and fixes for Wareable.com were up to me to manage. Some of the fixes, such as the Navigation bar rework, were tasks I self-assigned as I completed other needed tasks.

The website looks great, I love image-heavy and image-friendly layouts!

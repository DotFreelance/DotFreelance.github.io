 My name is Paul.

I'm a web &amp; software developer. I tend to consider myself a generalist. I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science.

When it comes to technology and the philosophy of developing software, my goal is ubiquity. Our technology should work for us. It should blend into our lives.

The web is a complex tech stack, and an interesting one. It's evolving to become the largest industry, pushing its way onto mobile and offering more and more capability every day. With progressive web apps, new browser APIs and full software-as-a-service platforms, it's never been easier to bring an idea to life.

Let me help you bring your ideas to life.
